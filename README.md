p3d-dl-script
=============

A userscript to export .obj files from P3d.in  

This script allows you to export a .OBJ file from a P3D model by clicking the (script-generated) 'Download .OBJ' button   below the 'Share or embed this model' button on the left button panel of the model viewer page.  

Installation:  
You must install the userscript to see the download button on the model viewer page.  
To do this, you must have a userscript manager installed.  
  If you have one installed, clicking on [this   link](https://github.com/reinitialized/p3d-dl-script/raw/master/p3d-dl-script.user.js) should bring up a prompt to install the script.  
  I have tested the script so far on [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome) and [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).
